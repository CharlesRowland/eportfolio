<h1>Black and Yellow Team - Black Box - Claim Evidence Reasoning</h1>
<h3>By Charles Rowland</h3>
<p id="intro">The purpose of this investigation is to figure out a way that a Black Box could have input water inside of it, but a different output water as you add more. Our team has designed, annotated, and reconfigured models to build a potential model of how this black box works.</p>
<h2>CLAIM</h2>
<p>          The mechanism inside the Black Box is a tank in which water goes in, and the tank is also connected to another tank, which water also fills, when the water gets to a certain point, a portion of the water will exit the tank.<p>
<h2>EVIDENCE</h2>
<p>          The mystery black box, where water is the input, and a different amount is the output. What we have noticed about the data of the mystery black box, is that when you run trials with so much input water, nothing comes out of the tube, but when you fill the tank enough, a lot more will come out. If you perform more trials after this, water will come out but only 60-65% of the water that went in might come out. To figure out how this box works, we ran multiple tests and observed water output and concluded that it had to be a tank that fills and something to trigger the water to exit the tank or it gets to a limit for water to exit the tank. We created a model involving 2 tanks, one filled with water, and once it gets to a limit it brings water into the 2nd tank, and when that gets to a limit, water will exit the tank. Our first trial of the model we had 250 ml input with a 0 ml output, the second trial we had 500 ml input with 250 ml output in 21.75 s. Our 3rd trial we had 250 ml output in 17 s.<p>
<h2>REASONING I</h2>
<p>          We used a physical model to demonstrate how we thought the black box could operate. Models can represent how you want a real design to work, except in a simpler conception, and can be either bigger or smaller than the true thing. There are many variants of models such as digital, 3d, and drawing on paper. Our model helped us get the message of our design and gave us a fast building time.<p>
<h2>REASONING II</h2>
<p>          Our evidence has shown that our model was able to accurately depict what could be inside the Mystery Black Box on a smaller scale. We ran multiple tests that are similar to the differences to the Black Box Tests, which could lead us to conclude that our design fits with the boundaries of the design.<p>
<h2>REASONING III</h2>
<p>           If an alternate claim, such as a different mechanism for the box, were to be correct, then it could differ from the initial data, the water input and output would be much different and the different operations of the mechanism could affect the time by a bit as well. This means my other claim would be flawed and inaccurate according to this data.<p>

<h2>RENDERED 3D MODEL OF BLACK BOX</h2>

<p>Originally, my teamâ€™s black box model was completely different from this. We had a larger mechanism that would most likely have done a better job at giving us proper data, it consisted of a ball for flotation, and when water would fill up the box, the ball would float up with it and then trigger a mechanism, although this was our originial plan, we could not build this model because of time restrictions and component issues. We were able to come up with the design we have now and it works accurately and smoothly. </p>

<h2>PERSONAL REFLECTION</h2>

<p>In this group project, I have helped produce, designed, and wrote the plans for our project and
it's final construction. I have also created an adequate 3D model of the final Black Box model, and
even though some of our designs did not go as planned, our team still managed to create a
box that can provide data closely related to the actual box. I managed to create animations in
Maya of the Black Box, and even used Merge to created an Augmented Reality version of the box
that we got to play around with. I learned new principles in design and animation in Autodesk
Maya and adequate information on how to use it, I also learned how to think quicker when
it comes to design and prototype issues and how to use augmented reality. The sucesses of the
project were coming up with a functional model, creating and animating a model, collecting
data for both the real and our group's model, and interacting with our model using augmented
reality. I really enjoyed the 3D modeling part since I already have a little experience in that
field. I did struggle with the overall construction of our original design because of component
issues and scarcity of components, which led us to our newer and final design. Next project, I
could plan better and work a little faster within my time range to produce an elegant model and
prototype.</p>

<h2>21st Century Skill Reflection</h2>

	<p>The 21st century skill I believe I grew the most in is critical thinking and problem solving, specifically emphasizing the ability to solve problems. I believe that I was at least at a competent level in this section, and was able to come up with solid solutions to problems throughout the process. The problems that showed up during this project were successfully executing the design for the black box problem and a matter of having material to construct it. To resolve these issues, our group had to improvise on materials we already had provided by our teacher and come up with a refined, more elegant design, to therefore get the project done more efficiently and at a faster rate. I persisted to solve problems by first understanding them. Once I understood what the problem was, I already solved fifty percent of it. Then executing the solution was the easier part when I understood what the solution had to be. To overcome my desire to give up, I did not stop thinking about making solutions easy to build to complete the project, and used my knowledge to create mechanisms for the issues that helped solve the problems.</p>
